This folder houses all of my works based on the Free Men Don't Ask Polymer80 Glock files. 
In order to complete these frames, you will need P80 rails, which can be found at:

Heres a small story for you. My state.... well, my state sucks for Pro-2A people like myself. 
It is now illegal to own 80%, "non-detectable", and "Primarily 3d printed" firearms. After reviewing the verbage of the state law, Federal law, and ATF codes, I have found a way to LEGALLY make these firearms. Each glock frame that you find in these pages will have a modified picatinny rail. This modification allows for a section of metal (24ga) with a outside dimension of 1.5" x 25/64" to be inserted into the frame while being printed. This will circumvent the qualification of these pieces as "undetectable" and also allows for a location on the frame to be serialized. Now I know what you're saying "Doesn't that defeat the purpose of all this?" Yes, but also ... no. You see, YOU as the "Maker" of the firearm, can choose and supply your own "Serial Number". You are not required by law (federally and in most states) to register said serial number. So at the end of the day... nobody even knows its there. So what has changed?

Each file that has the serial plate pocket open will be titled with the suffix w/serial. All others will have the void filled and can be printed as-is.
